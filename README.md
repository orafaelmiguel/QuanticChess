## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **CMake** (version 3.16 or higher)
- **C++ Compiler** with C++17 support:
  - GCC 7+ or
  - Clang 5+ or 
  - MSVC 2017+ (Visual Studio)

## 🔧 How to Build

### First Build

1. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Quantum-chess
   ```

2. **Configure project with CMake:**
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -S .
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cmake --build build
   ```

### Quick Build (after first time)

```bash
cmake --build build
```

## ▶️ How to Run

### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\build\Debug\quantum_chess.exe
```

### On Linux/Mac:
```bash
./build/quantum_chess
```

## 🧪 Build with Tests

To include tests in the build:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build
```

## 🐛 Debug Mode

To build in debug mode:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

## 🚀 Release Mode

To build optimized for production:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

## 🧹 Clean

To clean build files:

```bash
# Remove entire build folder
rm -rf build

# Or on Windows PowerShell:
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build
```

## 📋 Next Steps

- [ ] Implement basic board classes
- [ ] Add quantum piece system
- [ ] Implement superposition mechanics
- [ ] Create measurement/collapse system
- [ ] Develop user interface
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Implement AI opponent
